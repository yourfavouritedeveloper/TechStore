# TechStore

![TechStore](./Frontend/public/brand.pn)

TechStore is a full-stack e-commerce web application focused on selling technology products such as mobile phones, laptops, and accessories.  
It features a modern React frontend with dynamic filtering and sorting, and a robust Spring Boot backend exposing REST APIs connected to a PostgreSQL database and Redis cache.  
The project is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and designed with JWT-based authentication for secure access.

## Purpose

The primary goal of TechStore is to demonstrate how to build a full-featured e-commerce platform using contemporary technologies. It showcases:

- Efficient frontend state management and UI filtering techniques  
- Secure backend development with JWT authentication and role-based access control  
- Integration with PostgreSQL for persistent data storage and Redis for caching  
- Deployment best practices using Docker and cloud hosting services  

This project also serves as a portfolio piece for fullstack Java developers who want to demonstrate real-world skills.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Register, login, and role-based access control using JWT tokens  
- **Product Catalog:** Browse products by categories such as mobile phones, laptops, and accessories  
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Dynamic client-side filters for price, date, popularity, and more  
- **Popular & Best-selling Products:** Separate sections highlighting trending and frequently purchased items  
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices  
- **RESTful API:** Backend exposing secure endpoints for product data, user management, and purchases  
- **Caching Layer:** Redis cache to improve response times for popular data  
- **Dockerized Setup:** Containerized backend and frontend for consistency across development and production  
- **Cloud Deployment:** Backend hosted on Render, frontend on GitHub Pages  


## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** React (with Vite), Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation, CSS modules for styling  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java 21), Spring Security with JWT, PostgreSQL as the main database, Redis for caching  
- **Storage:** Product images and static resources served securely with proper access control  
- **Deployment:** Docker for containerization, automated CI/CD pipelines for builds and deployments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have installed:

- [Java 21 JDK](https://adoptium.net/)
- [Gradle 8.5+](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/) (or yarn)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional but recommended)
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis server



## Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourfavouritedeveloper/TechStore.git
   cd TechStore/backend
   ```

2. **Configure database and cache:**

    - Edit src/main/resources/application.yml (or application.properties) and update the PostgreSQL and Redis connection properties:

   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db_name
       username: your_username
       password: your_password
     redis:
       host: localhost
       port: 6379
   ```

3. **Build the backend:**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build -x test
   ```

4. **Run the backend server:**

    -  Using Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

    - Or run the JAR directly:
    ```bash
    java -jar build/libs/techstore.jar
    ```

    - The backend will start on http://localhost:8080/api/v1.



## Frontend Setup


1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```   
    - The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

4. **Build the production version:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Preview the production build locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```



## Running with Docker

### Backend

1. **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t techstore-backend .
    ```

2. **Run the container::**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 techstore-backend
    ```
   - Make sure your PostgreSQL and Redis instances are accessible or containerized as well.

### Frontend

   - You can serve the production build with any static file server. For example:


     ```bash
     npm run build
     npx serve dist
     ```

   - Or deploy the build folder to GitHub Pages or any static hosting.


## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues:** Make sure backend allows requests from your frontend origin

- **Authentication:** Some endpoints require JWT tokens; ensure login is performed

- **Image Loading:** Verify authentication settings allow public access to /images/** if used publicly

- **404 Errors:** Confirm static assets are correctly served and URLs are properly formed

## Authentication and Security
- JWT-based authentication secures backend endpoints.

- Public endpoints such as product listings and image resources have been configured to allow unauthenticated access.

- Make sure to add /images/** and /api/v1/products/** to your Spring Security permitAll() configuration to prevent unauthorized errors on static assets and product API calls.



## CORS Configuration

To enable your frontend app to consume backend APIs without CORS errors:

- Configure CORS in your Spring Boot backend to allow requests from your frontend domain(s), e.g.:

```java
@Bean
public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {
    return new WebMvcConfigurer() {
        @Override
        public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
            registry.addMapping("/api/**")
                    .allowedOrigins("http://localhost:5173", "https://yourfavouritedeveloper.github.io")
                    .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE");
        }
    };
}
```

---

### Notes

- **Soft delete** endpoints mark the resource as inactive or closed but keep it in the database.
- **Hard delete** endpoints permanently remove the resource.
- Update endpoints expect partial updates via **query parameters**.
- Purchase creation requires `productId` (list of IDs) and `amount` as **request parameters**.



## Conclusion

This API provides a robust foundation for managing users, products, and purchases within the TechStore application.  
With clear RESTful conventions and support for both soft and hard deletes, it ensures flexibility and data integrity.
